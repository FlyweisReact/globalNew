        <h4>Tell us: What does being a TGG trainer mean to you?</h4>
        <p> <strong>KE: </strong> In 2016, I heard about the TA trainer auditions from choreographer Tony G. I thought what an amazing opportunity that
would be! Iâ€™ve always been into fitness and with my background of cheer, dance, and gymnastics, I figured this would be perfect.
However, it seemed so far-fetched at the time. In 2013, I had a traumatic cheerleading injury to my right elbow, resulting in 
multiple surgeries. After years of recovering, I went to the trainer auditions in September 2016, and just weeks later, received
the offer. I was thrilled! I knew how fulfilling it would feel to be able to call myself a TA trainer. </p>
